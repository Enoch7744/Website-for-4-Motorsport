     <h2>What is the 24hr Le Mans?</h2>
     <img height="500px" width="850px" src="./24hrleman.jpg" alt=“24hrLeman”>
     <p>The 24 Hour race of Le Mans, the race that teams like Audi, Porsche and Toyota have all competed in the past, a race that likes to test what is possible</p>
     <p>The idea for the Le mans 24 Hour races were originally developed to test the durability of materials and showcase innovative techniques, 24-hour races such as Le Mans or the Nürburgring Nordschleife are now highlights in the motorsports calendar.</p>
     <p>To be a winner here, you need more than just a powerful car and superior driver. According to racing legend Yannick Dalmas, “To get to the top, drivers, mechanics and crew have to start working together closely months before the race. Racing situations have to be simulated in the factory and the entire team needs to develop a really good feeling.” In 1999, Dalmas drove the legendary BMW V12 LMR with 635 hp of the winning team. “Right from the start, you need to have the same objective: victory!”</p>
